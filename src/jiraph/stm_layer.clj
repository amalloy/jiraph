(comment
  The STM layer stores a single ref, pointing to a series of whole-layer
  snapshots over time, one per committed revision. Each snapshot contains
  a :nodes section and a :meta section - the meta is managed entirely by
  jiraph.graph. Note that while metadata is revisioned, it does not keep a
  changelog like nodes do, so you can't meaningfully read metadata from a
  revision in the future (which you can do for nodes).

  The layer also tracks a current revision, to allow any snapshot to be
  viewed as if it were the full graph.

  So a sample STM layer might look like the following.

  {:revision 2
   :store (ref {0 {}
                1 {:meta {"some-key" "some-value"}
                   :nodes {"profile-4" {:name "Rita" :edges {"profile-9" {:rel :child}}}}}
                2 {:meta {"some-key" "other-value"}
                   :nodes {"profile-4" {:name "Rita" :edges {"profile-9" {:rel :child}}
                                        :age 39}
                           "profile-9" {:name "William"}}}})})
